TODO: describe how to modify functions
- need to rerun setup.py every time
- or! edit correct files in environment (difficult to push!)
- or! activate environmnet, and instead of importing fpcanalysis, import the repo files and edit away!


Actually, since we have converted to installing with conda env, you might be able to just run after editing source!!!`


Note- if there is ever any compatability issues, the full exact environment can be found in docs/environment_full.txt- This is the environment that was used while debugging the first major release!

Note that we use specific commit of postgkyl and that it needs to be updated in install.py to run
