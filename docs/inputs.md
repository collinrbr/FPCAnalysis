# Running Simulations

To analyze a simulation, we must of course have a simulation. Here, we describe how to run some simulations

## Gkeyll

Gkeyll can be installed and ran by following the installation instructions from the code's [documentation](https://gkeyll.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Example inputs can be found [here](https://github.com/ammarhakim/gkyl-paper-inp).

## dHybridR

Contact one of the authors for source code or a compiled version of dHybridR. See https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7901521 for example data (and input file for a shock simulation).

## Tristan

Currently, this analysis code is meant to work with Tristan mp1 data using the user_file given [here](inputs/tristanmp1/nonadiabaticelec/user_shock_twowalls.F90).
