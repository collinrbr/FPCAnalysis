TODO: mention that at one point iordered things epar, perp1, eperp2- but it is more common to load things eperp1, eperp2, epar (to correspond to x,y,z correctly). This can lead to some confusing ordering of some arrays and data strucutures, but everything has been self confirmed and is self consistent. Just be careful when wokring with the data so you keep things in the right order. TODO: fix this!
