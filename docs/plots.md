# Plots

There are many example plots that one can use, copy/paste, and/or modify as desired. They are found [here](FPCAnalysis/plots). They are categorized roughly by purpose. Here we describe the categories.

## oned

For one dimensional plots. For example, field value at fixed y,z as a function of x.

## twod

For two dimensional plots. For example, field value as at fixed z as a function of x and y.

## fourier

For plots that involve frequency or wavenumber. For example, the wavelet transform of a field.

## plotplume

For plots related to dispersion relations (often associated with the dispersion relation solver by Kris Klein et al called PLUME).

## table

For making tables. Mostly not used.

## velspace

For plots in velocity space. For example, plots of the correlation, CEi, as a function of vx,vy.
